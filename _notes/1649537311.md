In a pinch for a birthday present? Desperate for a going away gift? Buy a pot, a cucumber, toothpicks, chocolate, and candy to make aâ€¦ candy cactus?! ðŸ˜… This one was for my brother's 44th birthday.

In the background, there's a Stranger Things poster and vinyl record. The candy cactus is surrounded by natural plants." width="1080" height="1080" />
