I teamed up with [OpenAl's Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/) and had a lot of fun hacking on [interactive transcripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_transcripts) this weekend. The neural net handled the transcription, so I, the human, could focus on programming and implementing the user interface.

See the demo below or [live (in Swedish)](https://hejinter.net/avsnitt-4/#transkript).
