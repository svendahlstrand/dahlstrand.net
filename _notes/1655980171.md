I've had a lot of fun the last week exploring Robin Sloan's cozy new (proposed) internet protocol, [Spring '83](https://github.com/robinsloan/spring-83-spec#readme). So many cool things are happening: poetry, link sharing, bots. And, lots and lots of experiments. Early web vibes!

These cards have their own personal touch to them. The content and vibes differ. One is artsier, and another share links to other boards. It looks like a lot of fun!" width="1200" height="943" />
