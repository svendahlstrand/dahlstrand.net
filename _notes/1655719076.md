It's lunchtime, and I just emptied my feed reader.

* Derek Sivers thinks we should [write one sentence per line](https://sive.rs/1s).
* Weezer wants us all to [start spinning in circles](https://humanrecordplayer.com) (via [Waxy.org](https://waxy.org)).
* And I encourage you to read the beautifully illustrated [A Visual Guide to the Aztec Pantheon](https://pudding.cool/2022/06/aztec-gods/).
