3 Ã— Game Boy:

- Gekkio is doing God's work, [reverse engineering Game Boy's SM83 CPU core](https://github.com/Gekkio/gb-research/tree/main/sm83-cpu-core).
- [Allison added a hinge to a Game Boy](https://posts.decontextualize.com/pocket-sp/) that God never intended.
- Don't know if God had anything to do with it, but [Pierre fixed accents to letters](https://kemenaran.winosx.com/posts/zelda-links-awakening-turbo-francais-mod) in the french translation of Link's Awakening.
