Here's 3 Ã— Game Boy ([again](/1668541793/)):

* [A Game Boy emulator device](https://www.freethegameboy.info/) that harvests energy from the sun and your button mashing. More scientific papers like this, please. ðŸ¥º
* Travis Goodspeed's [Game Boy ROM Tutorial](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/gbrom-tutorial) reminds me of my piece, [How to Take Screenshots the Hard Way](https://github.com/svendahlstrand/game-boy-lcd-sniffing).
* Just look at [2bitboy's custom-made Camera+](https://2bittoy.carrd.co/) below. What a piece of art! ðŸ‘Œ
