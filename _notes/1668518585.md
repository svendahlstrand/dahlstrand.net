!!Con might be one of the coziest computer conferences there is. This year [Marlene](https://marlenemhangami.com/) shared how to impress your crush, [Anjana](https://nitter.net/anjanavakil)'s talk was a musical â€“ about Lambda Calculus, and I enjoyed [Omar](https://omar.website/)'s and [Nicole](https://nicole.pizza/)'s talks **and** their websites. [All the above and more are available over here.](https://bangbangcon.com/livestream.html)
