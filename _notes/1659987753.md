Is an online yard sale on a blog doable? Let's find out! I have [26 things for sale](https://dahlstrand.net/yard-sale/): MacBook Air, Commodore 64, AirPods, e-readers (Kindle, etc.), RÃ˜DE Podcaster, iPod Shuffle, PS5 controller, and more.

I ship worldwide, but it's probably easiest if you're in the EU. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
