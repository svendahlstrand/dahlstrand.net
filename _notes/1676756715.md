My new Micro.blog plug-in is a minimal, no-frills post editor. But it has one pretty magical feature: live previews!

See it in action below, [try it on my blog](https://dahlstrand.net/magic/), or look up ü¶Ñ *Magic Preview* in the plug-in directory. ‚ö†Ô∏è&nbsp;Read the **important** notice there before installing. Have fun!
