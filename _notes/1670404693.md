Apple's Self Service Repair program is [now available in Sweden](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/12/apple-launches-self-service-repair-in-europe/). I've performed repairs and battery replacements on Apple devices: haphazardly and for cheap, with hairdryers, etc. I'm curious, might try the official experience next time my iPhone 12 mini needs a new battery.
