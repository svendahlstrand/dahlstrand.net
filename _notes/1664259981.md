I've reached the bottom of my morning cup of coffee *and* feed reader.

- Got exposed to [a mild Return to Monkey Island spoiler](https://mixnmojo.com/news/The-Many-Epilogues-of-Return-to-Monkey-Island). (We are four hours in.)
- Learned about [Pika](https://superhighfives.com/pika), a lovely-looking color picker with accessibility in mind. h/t [web.dev](https://web.dev/testing-web-design-color-contrast/#pika-macos-application).
