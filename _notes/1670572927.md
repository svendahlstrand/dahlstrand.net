This [excellent guide to writing image descriptions](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-write-an-image-description-2f30d3bf5546) (alt texts) led me to [Access Guide](https://www.accessguide.io/), which looks like a helpful (and friendly) introduction to digital accessibility. Both are created by [Alex Chen](https://www.alexyingchen.com/) and found via [Gemma Copeland](https://gemmacope.land/writing/less-like-an-object-and-more-like-the-weather/).
