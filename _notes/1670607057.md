Happy [#FeedReaderFriday](https://dahlstrand.net/search-space/?q=%23FeedReaderFriday)! Today I'll share with you ~~2~~ 3 cartoonists to follow.

I absolutely adore [Sarah Andersen's](https://sarahcandersen.com/) semi-autobiographical comics. So relatable! Most of the time, I feel like they are about me (and/or Sanna)

Also, check out Elizabeth's and Jonathan's [War and Peas](https://warandpeas.com/).
