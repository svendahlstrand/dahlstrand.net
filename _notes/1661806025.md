I just emptied my RSS reader and learned three things.

* [China censors The Big Bang Theory](https://pudding.cool/2022/08/censorship/) pretty hard.
* Linus made a [theremin for the Commodore 64](https://www.linusakesson.net/hardware/theremin/index.php).
* [Google flags dads as criminals](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html) for taking care of their kids.

Bedtime!
