Aerial shot out the side window of a helicopter that is making a slow orbit of a desert archeological dig as it sheds altitude and comes in for a landing. ROTOR BLADE SOUND makes it impossible to hear anything else for the time being. Surrounding landscape is a flat and barren khaki-colored plain crusted with salt in some places and scarred by vehicle tracks. Disabled military vehicles, including a burned-out TANK with its turret impacted several meters away, suggest that there's been combat--but not recently.](/images/lagos-in-eridu.png){: width="1251" height="1054" }
