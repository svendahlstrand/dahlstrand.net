<img src="/images/green-beast.jpg" alt="Photo of lamp post entirely wrapped by a climbing vine. With a bit of imagination, it looks like a giraffe or maybe a Brontosaurus. A 36-year-old â€“ but it seems like a 6-year-old â€“ has drawn something resembling a dinosaur on top of the photo." width="906" height="1600" />
