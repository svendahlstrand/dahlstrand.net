Monday morning tidbits.

* Monica is [hallucinating with art models](https://meowni.ca/posts/hallucinations/).
* I'm thinking about running one of them, [Stable Diffusion, on my M1 Mac](https://replicate.com/blog/run-stable-diffusion-on-m1-mac).
* [Jason entered state fair competition and won](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvmvqm/an-ai-generated-artwork-won-first-place-at-a-state-fair-fine-arts-competition-and-artists-are-pissed) â€“ with AI-generated art. Rob has [thoughts about that](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1565430397533847553.html).
