![A screenshot of a blog with a Surprise me! link in the menu. The link is highlighted with the comment: "Click this and end up on a totally
random post on your blog. Every time! ðŸ¤¯"](/images/surprise-me.png)

See that ðŸŽ² *Surprise me!* link in the screenshot above? Every time it's clicked, the visitor is taken to a random post in the archive. You can have this too! Just install [my new Micro.blog plug-in](https://github.com/svendahlstrand/plugin-surprise-me#readme).
