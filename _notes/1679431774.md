Bill Gates on [The Age of AI has begun](https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun):

> First, we should try to balance fears about the downsides of AI—which are understandable and valid—with its ability to improve people’s lives. …
>  
> Second, market forces won’t naturally produce AI products and services that help the poorest. The opposite is more likely. …
>  
> Finally, we should keep in mind that we’re only at the beginning of what AI can accomplish. Whatever limitations it has today will be gone before we know it. …
>
> The Age of AI is filled with opportunities and responsibilities.
