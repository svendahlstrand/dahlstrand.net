For today's [#FeedReaderFriday](https://dahlstrand.net/search-space/?q=%23FeedReaderFriday), I made my RSS feed prettier. Before, the browser served a bunch of messy XML, but now you're greeted by [a friendly preview and instructions](https://dahlstrand.net/notes/feed.xml). ðŸ¥³

Based on [pretty-feed.xsl](https://github.com/genmon/aboutfeeds/blob/main/tools/pretty-feed-v3.xsl) by Matt Webb. You should add [Matt's blog](https://interconnected.org/home/) to your feed reader! ðŸ‘€

![A split view of the same web feed: before and after. The before shows a plain text XML representation of content. Boring! The after shows a pretty-looking preview of the same.](/images/pretty-rss.png){: width="1224" height="1224" }
