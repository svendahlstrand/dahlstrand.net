title: Online Yard Sale
---

Please, buy my stuff. üòÖ Currently, I have 25 things to be listed on eBay (or Tradera). But if you're quick, you can grab them before they are listed. I will give you a good deal.

Everything currently resides with me here in Sweden üá∏üá™, but I ship worldwide.

{% imagesize /images/yard-sale.jpg:img alt='A bunch of gadgets on a wooden table. Looks like a yard sale, but you know, online.' %}

## Soon to be listed, be quick! üöÄ

I haven't come around to photographing these yet. Reach out if you're interested, and I will snap some pictures for you.

Most of these are complete and in the original box. I take great care of my gadgets, so they are all in good shape.

Price? Give me an offer once you've seen the item's condition.
