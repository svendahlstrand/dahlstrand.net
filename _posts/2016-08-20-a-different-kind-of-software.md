Last winter my mom taught me the art of crocheting. Since then I've started to develop a different kind of "software."

## Pokey

My first project! I didn't intend to make it look like the ghost Pokey, from the Pacman games, but I think it does.

I used a pattern by Allison Hoffman. Why not [crochet your own monster][2]?

## Fanten

Amigurumi is the Japanese art of crocheting cute and often small creatures. This elephant made an excellent gift for a newborn baby.

MÃ³hu designed the pattern [Amigurumi Elephant][3].

## Yarny

The Swedish video game Unravel struck a chord in me. I fell in love so hard that I wanted to make my own Yarny, the protagonist in the story.

Martin Sahlin, Creative Director at Coldwood Interactive, shared [how to make your own Yarny][4].
