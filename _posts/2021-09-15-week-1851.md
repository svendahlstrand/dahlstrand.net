Thursday, we packed our bags and hit the road down south. We steered towards Brösarp and [Talldungen](https://www.talldungen.se/en/). When summer comes to an end, we go there for a night or two. It has stuck as a tradition. We went for a swim in the Baltic Sea, talked a lot, ate, and drank well.

We also played around with our cameras, snapping pictures of old fishing sheds, and tried catching waves on video. I'm pretty sure we'll be back again next year.

Sanna ran a book circle on Discord, and I joined to discuss the short story [Everything's Fine](https://www.tor.com/2020/07/15/everythings-fine-matthew-pridham/) by Matthew Pridham. It's interesting to learn about fellow readers' thoughts and opinions. This time around, everyone had interpreted the story roughly the same way. And most of us enjoyed it.

On the subject of being on the same page: I nodded along while reading [Documents ≠ Programs](https://mckinley.cc/blog/20210831.html).
