Pussel is my electronic game with the goal of lighting up sixteen buttons. It's easier said than done. My creation is an homage to [Lights Out][1] by American [Tiger Electronics][2], released in 1995.

In this project, I've made everything. Sure, I may have "borrowed" the rules of the game, but the design of the circuit and PCB is all me. I also wrote the firmware that makes the project tick. The case that contains all the components is 3D printed in polyamide plastic.

By the way: pussel is the Swedish word for a puzzle.
