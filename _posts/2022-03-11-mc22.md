title: Micro Camp 2022
---

I'm stoked to be presenting at [Micro Camp tomorrow, March 12](https://micro.camp/#day2). On a topic near and dear to my heart: web accessibility. This space will be updated in the future with:

* The video-on-demand version of my talk *Accessible Microblogging: A Crash Course*.
* A transcript of the same talk.
* Links to relevant resources.

See you here in a couple of days! ðŸ‘‹
