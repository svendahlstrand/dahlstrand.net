Let's see if I can get back into writing by posting on a regular schedule. Once a week. Cherry-picked tidbits from my life the last seven days. I've been alive for 1,849 weeks already, so, without further ado, here's what happened in the thirty-third week of 2021.

I got my second jab! üíâ It went smooth, 5 minutes of waiting for my turn and 30 minutes of relaxing after. The arm felt a bit sore for a couple of days, but no other side effects.

For some reason, [The Green Knight](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-green-knight/) didn't go up here in J√∂nk√∂ping. So, we went out of town to catch it. Totally worth it; the movie was phenomenal! Now, I look forward to [Robin's live reading of the book](https://www.robinsloan.com/live/) in January.

Sanna and I decided to spend our extended weekend at Sommarbo. And what a great decision that was. The water remained warm-ish, the sun shined, and we had a great time. We both agreed the air felt a bit different, though. Autumn is coming! üçÇ

We also sent [the second issue of our cozy newsletter](https://www.lasloss.se/brev-2) about reading. If you cherish books and can decipher Swedish, you should [subscribe](https://www.lasloss.se/nyhetsbrev/).
