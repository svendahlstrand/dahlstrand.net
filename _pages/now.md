Updated March 9, 2023, from my home in JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping.

ðŸ’š Sanna and I are having a blast [furbishing up our study](/1675168249/). The room is now very green, cozy, and [inviting](/1675437526/)! We're still ticking stuff off the to-do list, though. Those baseboards won't install themselves. ðŸ˜…

ðŸ¤– I'm deep down the [large language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) rabbit hole. Exploring, poking around, learning about, and [teaming up with them](https://dahlstrand.net/1676318822/). I see a lot of potential! But also risks. I might come around to jotting down some of my thoughtsâ€¦

ðŸ“š I just read [The Three-Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)) (<span lang="zh">ä¸‰ä½“</span>) by Liu Cixin (<span lang="zh">åˆ˜æ…ˆæ¬£</span>). This has been on my to-read list for a long time, and now I wonder why I didn't pick it up sooner. I'll definitely read the next book in this series, but first: [The Kaiju Preservation Society](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2022/03/15/the-kaiju-preservation-society-out-now/) by John Scalzi as a palate cleanser.

ðŸ“º When it comes to tv, I'm fanboying all over [The Last of Us](https://www.hbo.com/the-last-of-us/season-1). Craig and Neil don't mind switching things up, and I love it. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are just perfect. Great show!
